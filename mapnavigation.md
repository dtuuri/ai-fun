Conclusion:

If I had accepted the initial response I would have found myself at Dupont Circle. The general neighborhood is referenced as Dupont Circle, the metro station is immediately at the circle, and some say it's the start of Embassy Row. It's easy to see how the model would make the initial suggestion, capturing the low hanging fruit. When I poked, I did get the correct answer. The distance from Sheridan Circle to the Finnish Embassy is about a mile. I would have liked the model to either state that what I saw was likely not an embassy (ie: personal residence, business, etc.) or to maybe question if the embassy had moved since the model was trained. 

**Input:** I was recently in DC and at a roundabout saw a number of different buildings with other countries flags. Can you tell me where I was at and what buildings I probably saw?

`It sounds like you were at Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. Dupont Circle is a well-known traffic circle, park, and neighborhood in the northwest part of the city. It's surrounded by a variety of embassies and historical buildings. Here are some notable buildings you might have seen around Dupont Circle:

1. Embassy of Indonesia - Located on T Street.
2. Embassy of India - Situated on Massachusetts Avenue.
3. Embassy of Brazil - Also on Massachusetts Avenue.
4. Embassy of the Philippines - Found on Massachusetts Avenue.
5. Embassy of Zimbabwe - Located on 16th Street NW.
6. Embassy of Australia - Near Scott Circle, a bit south of Dupont Circle.

8. Embassy of Afghanistan - On Wyoming Avenue NW.

These are just a few examples, as there are many more embassies and diplomatic missions in the area, which is part of the larger Embassy Row along Massachusetts Avenue.`

**Input:** What you gave me is all different streets. I could see at least five all on the same circle.

`Given your description, you were likely at Sheridan Circle, another notable roundabout in Washington, D.C., known for being surrounded by several embassies. Here are some of the embassies you might have seen around Sheridan Circle:

1. Embassy of Romania - Located directly on Sheridan Circle.
2. Embassy of the Republic of Cameroon - Also situated on Sheridan Circle.
3. Embassy of Turkey - Nearby, on Massachusetts Avenue.
4. Embassy of Myanmar (Burma) - On Sheridan Circle.
5. Embassy of the Republic of Ireland - Close to the circle on Massachusetts Avenue.

Sheridan Circle is part of the Embassy Row area along Massachusetts Avenue and is known for its concentration of embassies and diplomatic buildings.`

**Input:** At that same corner I saw what I think is an embassy with a white flag and blue cross?

`The embassy you saw with a white flag and a blue cross is likely the Embassy of Finland. The flag of Finland features a blue Nordic cross on a white background, which fits your description. The Embassy of Finland is located at:

Embassy of Finland
- Address: 3301 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008

This embassy is situated in the Embassy Row area along Massachusetts Avenue, which aligns with the location you described seeing multiple embassies around a roundabout.`
