Reflection:

I did not feel that I received a meaningful or beneficial response to my input. In some past examples I've seen prompts such as this generate a more personal level of engagement even speaking first person. This was not the case. 

Input:
I am nervous about taking my Praxis 7-12 Math exam in eight weeks. What school has the highest pass rate for this exam? What part of the exam do people struggle with the most?

Response:

## Highest Pass Rates

Finding the school with the highest pass rate for the Praxis 7-12 Math exam can be challenging as specific school pass rates are not typically published. However, schools with rigorous teacher preparation programs and higher academic standards tend to have better pass rates.

### Factors Contributing to Higher Pass Rates:
- Higher academic performance in college (higher GPA and SAT scores)
- More challenging coursework
- Extensive study and preparation for the Praxis exams&#8203;:citation[oaicite:5]{index=5}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;.

## Common Struggles

The Praxis 7-12 Math exam covers several content areas, and test-takers often struggle with different parts. Commonly challenging areas include:
- Algebra and Functions
- Geometry and Measurement
- Statistics and Probability

A significant issue many test-takers face is the breadth of knowledge required and the application of mathematical concepts to solve complex problems within the time constraints&#8203;:citation[oaicite:3]{index=3}&#8203;.

## Study Strategies

To improve your chances of passing, consider focusing on these strategies:
1. **Study Plan:** Create a detailed study schedule that covers all test content areas, allowing more time for the topics you find most challenging.
2. **Practice Tests:** Take multiple practice tests to familiarize yourself with the format and timing of the exam.
3. **Review Weak Areas:** Spend additional time reviewing areas where you score the lowest on practice tests.
4. **Study Resources:** Use a variety of study materials, such as prep books, online courses, and tutoring services.

Good preparation and a solid understanding of the exam format can help alleviate anxiety and increase your chances of success.

## ASE Brakes ##

Reflection:
I did not check the actual sources so can not vouch for accuracy. If I were to redo this prompt I might ask for more information about the specific standards or reference pages. While it did include a singular YouTube video I felt that my prompt asked for reading material and videos to be posted directly with the individual topics. I'm not sure the complexity of this credential or what the total repository of available resources might look like. The model did quickly recognize the appropriate test I was taking, despite me not clearly specifying the entire name and without deep context.

Input:
I'm taking ASE Brakes in two weeks and need to create a study guide. Can you list all of the objectives in a table, provide me a link to reading material, and a youtube video link. I also need 5 questions written in the style I might find on the exam.
