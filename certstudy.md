Reflection:
I did not check the actual sources so can not vouch for accuracy. If I were to redo this prompt I might ask for more information about the specific standards or reference pages. While it did include a singular YouTube video I felt that my prompt asked for reading material and videos to be posted directly with the individual topics. I'm not sure the complexity of this credential or what the total repository of available resources might look like. The model did quickly recognize the appropriate test I was taking, despite me not clearly specifying the entire name and without deep context.
