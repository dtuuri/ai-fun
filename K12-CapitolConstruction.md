# Why European Materials Were Used in the Construction of the US Capitol for 8th Graders

## 1. 1000 Word Overview

**Why European Materials Were Used in the Construction of the US Capitol**

The United States Capitol is one of the most iconic buildings in America. Located in Washington, D.C., it houses the United States Congress and is the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. The construction of this magnificent building, which began in the late 18th century, involved a variety of materials, including some sourced from Europe. But why did the builders of the Capitol turn to Europe for some of their materials? This decision was influenced by several factors, including quality, availability, expertise, and aesthetics.

**Historical Context and Construction**

Construction of the U.S. Capitol began in 1793, with the laying of the cornerstone by President George Washington. The building was designed by William Thornton, a British-American architect whose design was selected through a competition. However, the construction process was lengthy and complex, involving several architects and numerous changes to the original design.

During the early years of the United States, the country was still developing its infrastructure and industries. The colonies had only recently gained independence from Britain, and while there was a strong desire to build a distinct national identity, there were practical limitations. One of these limitations was the availability and quality of building materials. Europe, particularly Britain, had a well-established tradition of architecture and construction, with access to high-quality materials and skilled artisans.

**Quality and Availability**

At the time, America lacked the capability to produce certain high-quality materials that were readily available in Europe. For example, white marble, which was used extensively in the Capitol's construction, was imported from Italy. Italian marble was renowned for its superior quality and beauty. Similarly, other types of stone, such as sandstone, were sourced from European quarries because they met the aesthetic and durability standards required for the Capitol.

In addition to marble, slate for roofing and iron for structural components were also imported from Europe. The quality of these materials was essential for the longevity and appearance of the Capitol. European quarries and foundries had centuries of experience in producing these materials, making them a reliable source for the high standards needed.

**Expertise and Craftsmanship**

The construction of the Capitol also required skilled craftsmen, many of whom were European immigrants or had been trained in Europe. These artisans brought with them techniques and knowledge that were not yet widespread in the United States. For instance, the intricate stone carvings and sculptures that adorn the Capitol were often created by European sculptors or those trained in the European tradition.

One notable example is the Italian sculptor Luigi Persico, who created several statues for the Capitol. His work demonstrated the high level of craftsmanship that European artisans could provide. The use of skilled European labor helped ensure that the Capitol would be a building of great beauty and structural integrity.

**Aesthetics and Symbolism**

The choice of European materials was also influenced by the aesthetic and symbolic goals of the Capitol's designers. The architects wanted the Capitol to reflect the ideals of democracy and the classical heritage that inspired the founding fathers. Classical architecture, which drew heavily on Greek and Roman styles, was seen as embodying the principles of democracy, stability, and grandeur.

To achieve this classical look, the architects used materials that were traditionally associated with classical architecture, many of which were sourced from Europe. Marble, for instance, was widely used in ancient Greek and Roman buildings and was thus a natural choice for the Capitol. The use of these materials helped to convey the message that the United States was a worthy successor to the great democracies of the past.

**Conclusion**

The decision to use European materials in the construction of the U.S. Capitol was driven by a combination of practical and symbolic factors. The superior quality and availability of European materials, the expertise of European craftsmen, and the desire to create a building that reflected classical ideals all played a role. As a result, the Capitol stands today not only as a functional seat of government but also as a symbol of the nation's aspirations and connections to a broader architectural and cultural heritage.
